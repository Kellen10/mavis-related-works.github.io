      <p>Advanced AI assistants are advanced natural language interfaces that can autonomously plan and execute tasks on behalf of users, potentially transforming work, education, and personal interactions. However, the paper highlights some serious ethical and societal challenges which includes issues of value alignment, safety, trust, and misuse that must be carefully addressed through coordinated technical, policy, and evaluative efforts.</p>

    <li>The ways that older people interact with voice assistants can vary drastically compared to their younger counterparts. As people age, their cognitive abilities decrease and the way that they are expected to speak to voice assistants may start to stray from the truth. This paper looks into how to better address this change in speech patterns in order to create an accurate and effective voice assistant for all types of consumers.</li>
