  <p>Advanced AI assistants are advanced natural language interfaces that can autonomously plan and execute tasks on behalf of users, potentially transforming work, education, and personal interactions. However, the paper highlights some serious ethical and societal challenges which includes issues of value alignment, safety, trust, and misuse that must be carefully addressed through coordinated technical, policy, and evaluative efforts.</p>

  <p>This paper posits speech as context-rich and delineates a strong need for a functional and versatile AI technology that integrates and follows speech and language prompts. The paper follows the methodology involved in the researchers’ own speech recognition model, Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM), in conjunction with a corresponding dataset intended to address the paucity of ‘open-source speech-text cross-modal instruction-following’ datasets. This is tangential to our project, although we may diverge in our execution by implementing a futuristic-like user interface or giving our model a certain persona.</p>

  <p>The ways that older people interact with voice assistants can vary drastically compared to their younger counterparts. As people age, their cognitive abilities decrease and the way that they are expected to speak to voice assistants may start to stray from the truth. This paper looks into how to better address this change in speech patterns in order to create an accurate and effective voice assistant for all types of consumers.</p>

  <p>This paper gives an in-depth introduction to what natural language processing is. It gives advice on different issues that you will face while working with NLP alongside different terms and ways to structure a program that can correctly understand language.</p>

  <p>This paper explores an AI-driven system for detecting emotions in speech. Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification, the system enhances smart home assistants by improving emotional awareness and response accuracy. The research highlights the integration of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and covariance matrices to refine emotion recognition in real-time. This could be helpful in making our speech bot obtain more "witt" like the ones in the movies.</p>

  <p>This paper presents “My-Assistant” to study speech recognition and natural language understanding (NLU) techniques such as pre-processing, speech signal processing, intent identification, and response generation. It also touches on system integrations, task execution strategies, and performance metrics of virtual assistants. It emphasizes increasing the accuracy of speech recognition, intent identification, and response quality using deep learning and API integrations.</p>

  <p>This paper looks into designing a speech-controlled AI assistant in a React-based web application that is capable of recognizing and creating new speech. The system is made using the Web Speech API to execute speech-to-text conversion and response synthesis and OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 API for natural language processing. The paper examines usability, constraints, and optimizations of the system for real-time use.</p>

<h2>What's Different?</h2>
What sets our MAVIS project apart from the voice assistants we looked into is the character aspect of it. We are taking inspiration from JARVIS from the Iron Man movies in the way that the voice assistant will be conversational. Unlike Siri, it will be witty and interact with the user in a human-like manner rather than just take instructions.
